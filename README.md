Project 1

10/13/2022

After extensive brainstorming and coming up with ideas for the first project
have finally concluded that it will be themed after two of my favorite superheroes
Batman and Superman. The game will give you the option to choose either
character to play as, The basics of the game depending on whichever character
you select will be the attempt to save their significant other. Superman flies
through Metropolis to save his fianc√© Lois Lane before the evil Darkseid takes her life, will he make it in time?
Only you can decide, Batman has a similar task the joker has captured his Beautiful Selina Kyle for him to stop the joker from
pumping her veins with sulfuric acid he has to fly into Gotham past the joker's minions, and capture her without being shot
